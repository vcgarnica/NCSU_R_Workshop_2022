# NCSU R workshop 2022

This repository is designed to serve as a companion to the R workshop held at North Carolina
State University on October 28th and November 11th. 


Workshop Outcomes
-----------------

In this workshop, we expect to present enough information to get you started on 
your way to learning R. Because this is a four hour workshop, our goal is to 
demonstrate a simple analysis in R, emphasizing problem solving and 
troubleshooting. By the end of the workshop you should have just enough
background to be able to learn more.
